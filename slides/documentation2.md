### Documentation

* Document not only _what_ something does, but _why_
* Documentation is only useful when it's accurate
	* Make docs part of code review <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Of course, the only thing worse than not having documentation is bad documentation. If the arguments or purpose of a function have changed but the docs haven't been updated, that's a big problem.

For this reason, I recommend making documentation updates a required part of the code review process. If a function changes but the relevant docs aren't updated, that's a blocker.
