Note:

What have we learned today?

First, technical debt is inevitable – we can't build things without incurring some sort of debt. What we *can* do is make sure we're minimizing the impact of it.

We've ever vigilant, always watching for red flags in our projects.

We're documenting not only how something works, but why it's there. That, combined with code review, is lowering our bus factor.

We're ensuring that not only are we writing tests, but we're focused on the result, not the implementation.

We're making sure we're cleaning up old functionality that we don't need anymore, and making sure new functionality we write can easily be removed later, if necessary.

We're being smart about how we handle application dependencies.

And finally, we're resisting the urge to jump on every bandwagon that rolls through town.
