### Good and Bad technical debt

* Good: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Well documented + tested business logic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Bad: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Exceptions, work-arounds, "hacks" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* "Black boxes" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Spaghetti code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Just like with personal finance, there's good and bad technical debt.

Good debt is the stuff you and your team understand: it's clear in what it does, hopefully it has some tests around it, and it's basically just the cost of doing business.

This doesn't mean it's perfect code, but it's understood what it does.

The bad is where things get ugly, and we'll go through each of these: exceptions, black boxes, and spaghetti code.
