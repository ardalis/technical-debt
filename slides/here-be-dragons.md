### Here be Dragons

Note:

Another form of bad technical debt are "black boxes", where data goes in and comes out, but nobody on the team is quite sure *how* it works. It's like the beginning of every science fiction movie, and now Jeff Goldblum is going to have to swoop in and save the day.

Black boxes, or files with comments like "here be dragons" or "I don't know why this works, it just does" should be high on your list of technical debts to pay off.

Files like this also have a nasty habit of growing over time, when a developer can grok just enough to extend it before going off and disappearing under "mysterious circumstances"
