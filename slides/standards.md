### Standards

> A good codebase reads like it was written by a team that was on the same page.

Note:

Likewise, standardizing the way you write your code can go a long way towards keeping your codebase organized.

Not just spaces v tabs, but procedural v. OOP, namespaces, organization, etc.

Ultimately, a good codebase will read like it was written by a team that was on the same page, not a handful of separate developers at separate times.
