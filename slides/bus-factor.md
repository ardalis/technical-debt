### Bus Factor <!-- .element: class="bus-factor-logo" -->

Note:

Sincerely hope it doesn't happen to anyone in this room

Managers like to joke about the "bus" factor - how screwed would we be if any given engineer gets hit by a bus

Shared knowledge reduces risk of the only person who understands something getting sick, bussed, or quitting
