### Spaghetti Code

Note:

If your application codebase looks like this slide, you have big problems.

Spaghetti code is usually poorly thought-out, and causes developers to waste a ton of time trying to untangle it all.

That's time, energy, and money wasted every time something needs to be done. It's also a breeding ground for tough-to-track-down bugs.

Also, so many carbs.
