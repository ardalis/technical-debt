* Banking systems still running COBOL <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* "Optimized for Internet Explorer" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Outdated WordPress installations <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* "Quick fixes" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* "Legacy" applications <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
