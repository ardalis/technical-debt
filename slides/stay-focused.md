### Stay focused!

Note:

This can be a hard pill to swallow, but most teams are good at a small set of technologies; there's a whole lot of stuff that they're not so good at. In fact, I'd argue that there's quite a bit they rather suck at.

It's great to experiment and try new things, but if you're maintaining a dozen different apps in a dozen different languages and frameworks, maintenance is going to be the bane of your existence.

If you adopt new technologies, make sure you're adopting the commitment and talent to support it moving forward, too.
