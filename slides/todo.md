#### `@todo Make this not awful`

Note:

Every time you add an exception, a work-around, a "quick-fix" – whatever you want to call it – you're incurring further *bad* technical debt.

Two years from now, are developers – even yourself, if you're still working on that codebase – remember what that was for, or it going to live-on as a mystery lost to the ages?

I should point out that the slide title, "@todo make this not awful" was just me being snarky, but I've seen – and written this – in codebases. As an engineer, I'd love to see the code written well from the beginning, but I also appreciate someone warning me that this is something that will be a pain-point.
