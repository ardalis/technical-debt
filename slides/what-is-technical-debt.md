### What is Technical Debt?

> A concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution

Note:

Keep in mind that technical debt is not simply "bad code", but any technical decision made that must now be supported moving forward.

The goal is to meet your company or client's business needs with as little debt to pay down as possible.
