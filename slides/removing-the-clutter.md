#### Removing the clutter

* If functionality is no longer needed, throw it away!
* Write new functionality so it can be removed easily <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

This is one of my favorite and least favorite parts of maintaining a codebase: determining what we don't need to maintain any more and getting rid of it.

That feature you had to write for a special event two years ago? The work-arounds for some legacy code that you've since replaced? Burn it all down.

To help future-you, there are also ways you can make it easier to remove functionality in the future.
